What is Operating System?

It is an interface between user and the hardware

As the hardware understands only binaries(1,0) and user can understand human readable language

OS converts the human readable to binaries and binaries to human readable to have a perfect communication between both.



 Client Operating System:Windows10,Windows7,WindowsXP
		         Ubuntu Desktop

 ServerOperating System: RHEL7,Suse,BSD,Ubuntu,Unix
			Windows2016,Windows2012, Windows2008/R2

Why many people were using Linux Operating System only for deploy and running Applications?
	Linux= Security,Stable



Unix
-----

 Single user 	----	Single Task	--ex:- DoS 
 Single user	----	Multi Task	-- Windows
 Multiuser		----	Multitask		-- UNIX


  FSF  = Free Software Foundation
  GNU = Generally Not Unix

   
 Unix History
 ---------------
 [Source Code + Application]
 
       Kernel + Application    ->O/s  -> 1969, AT& T Labs, Unix

 1984 --- HP      	  ----- HP-UX
 1984 ---Apple  	  ----- MacOS
 1986 ---IBM              ----- AIX
 1991 ---Sun/Oracle ----- SunSolaris

 Note: The above all operating systems are Hardware dependent i.e these Os will work only on the relevant hardware, but 
            it will not support other software & hardwares



   FSF---GNU
     1991 --- Helsinky University during summer holidays,  Linus Torvalds has developed the linux i.e [GNU Kernel + Software]


  Later other Linux flavours introduced in the market are:
	- Novell  ----Suse
	- REDHAT --- RHL/RHEL
	-Centos,OEL, Fedora,Debian,Mint,Puppy,Kali*, BoSS,PowerLinux,Ubuntu

Features of Linux
--------------------

Portable = Portability means software's can works on different types of hardware in same way. 
                      Linux kernel and application programs supports their installation of any kind of hardware 
                      platform.
Opensource= Linux source code is freely available and it is community based development project.

Multi-user= Linux is a multiuser system means multiple users can access system resources.

Multiprogramming=Linux is a multiprogramming system means multiple applications can run at same 
                                    time.

Shell= Linux provides a special interpreter program which can be used to execute commands of the 
             operating system.

Security=Linux provides user security using authentication features like password protection/controlled
                access to specified files/encryption of data.
