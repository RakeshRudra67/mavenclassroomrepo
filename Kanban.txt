Kanban

Kanban is a visual system for managing work as it moves through a process. Kanban visualizes both the process (the workflow) and the actual work passing through that process.

- Kanban is one of the Lean tools designed to reduce the idle time in a production process. 
- The main idea behind the Kanban system is to deliver what the process needs exactly when it needs it.
   In Japanese, the word "Kan" means "visual" and "ban" means "card," so Kanban refers to visual cards.

- Kanban is a popular framework used to implement agile software development. It requires real-time     communication of capacity and full transparency of work.

- Work items are represented visually on a kanban board, allowing team members to see the state of every piece of   work at any time
